# Features
### For Companies
**Improved Data Integrity and Forensics**: With the ability to compare and analyze databases, identifying inconsistencies and discrepancies enables companies to make informed decisions and maintain accurate information. The sync feature then gives you the power to restore data integrity.

**Confidence**: Whether you are deploying to production or in the development stage, you can ensure the data is as expected, while also proactively catching previously unseen issues and preventing data corruption in your production environment.

**Enhanced Productivity**: Companies can benefit from increased productivity as the app automates complex tasks such as data migration, synchronization, and production deployment, reducing manual efforts and potential errors.
#
### For Developers
**Productivity**: With the ability to synchronize your database to a known state before running your code and then comparing the differences after it changed data, you can verify the changes were as expected.

**Release With Confidence**: The app empowers developers to preview changes and assess their impact before deploying to the production environment, minimizing the risk of errors and maintaining a stable system.

**Deployment Scripts**: Manually added some data to your development database during the sprint? Easily check what was added and let Compare41 make the sync scripts for your deployment.

**Deep Synchronization**: Need to copy a complete sub graph to replicate an issue? Besides synchronizing whole entities, you can select a node and select which related sub graph to synchronize.
#
### For Database Administrators
**Forensics and Investigation**: Effortlessly compare your production database with a backup and identify data changes, discrepancies and potential issues.

**Data Recovery**: Restore only the relevant sub graph of your backup but keep the changes made to production data after your backup was made.

**Data Migration**: The app streamlines the data migration process, making it straightforward for administrators to transfer data between databases seamlessly.

**Data-preparation**: Do fine-graded fixes of your data in isolation and sync this fixed data to your production database in a controlled way.
